# Hyperspectral Image Classification with SVM and PCA

This project is a study on hyperspectral image classification using SVM (Support Vector Machine) as a shallow method and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction. The project is implemented on the Indian Pines and Pavia University datasets, aiming to effectively classify hyperspectral data and reduce dimensions using SVM and PCA.

## Dataset
Indian Pines and Pavia University hyperspectral datasets are used in this project. The datasets contain hyperspectral images with various surface and object types.
